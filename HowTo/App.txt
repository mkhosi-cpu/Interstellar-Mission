The Flask app is a mission status monitoring service that simulates and returns the current status of various systems on a hypothetical mission (e.g., a space mission).

What the App Does:
Endpoint:
The app provides a single API endpoint at /status.
When accessed (via a web browser or API client), it returns a JSON response containing:
The overall mission status.
The current status of key onboard systems.
A fixed mission time.

Expected JSON Output Example:
When a user makes a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/status, the app responds with JSON data like this:


{
    "overall_status": "Caution",
    "system_statuses": {
        "Life Support": "OK",
        "Navigation": "Critical",
        "Communication": "Warning",
        "Propulsion": "OK"
    },
    "mission_time": "Day 42, Hour 15"

}



Potential Use Cases:
This app could be used for:

Simulating mission control systems (for training or testing purposes).
Developing a dashboard to visualize system health.
Creating a monitoring API for a spacecraft, ship, or remote facility.
